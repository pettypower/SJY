Bundle-Description: This bundle provides SLF4j implementation and conf
 iguration required to run m2e embedded Maven runtime  in external JVM
 . This bundle is NOT a general purpose slf4j-simple OSGi bundle, it d
 oes NOT export  any packages and it CANNOT be used as an OSGI SLF4J i
 mplementation.  This is suboptimal and a better solution would be to 
 either include slf4j-simple as a resource in  org.eclipse.m2e.maven.r
 untime or use SLF4J implementation of the running m2e instance. I cou
 ld not  find an easy way to implement either of the better solutions,
  so this one will have to do for now.   This bundle is referenced as 
 Require-Bundle by org.eclipse.m2e.maven.runtime to force installation
   of this bundle whenever m2e embedded maven runtime is installed. Be
 cause no packages are exported,  this does not pollute OSGi classpath
 . Provide-Capability/Require-Capability would be cleaner, but  I don'
 t know if these are supported bu P2.
